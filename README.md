The Boston House Price Estimator is a web-based application that leverages machine learning techniques to predict the prices of houses in the Boston area based on a variety of features. These features encapsulate various socio-economic, environmental, and structural aspects of the properties and their surrounding areas. The prediction model uses the following key features:

- **CRIM**: Per capita crime rate by town.
- **ZN**: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
- **INDUS**: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
- **CHAS**: Charles River dummy variable (1 if the tract bounds the river; 0 otherwise).
- **NOX**: Concentration of nitric oxides (parts per 10 million).
- **RM**: Average number of rooms per dwelling.
- **AGE**: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
- **DIS**: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers.
- **RAD**: Index of accessibility to radial highways.
- **TAX**: Full-value property-tax rate per $10,000.
- **PTRATIO**: Pupil-teacher ratio by town.
- **B**: A measure based on the proportion of black people by town, calculated as \(1000(Bk - 0.63)^2\), where \(Bk\) is the proportion of black people by town.
- **LSTAT**: Percentage of the population classified as lower status.

The application utilizes these diverse attributes to provide a comprehensive estimate of house prices, reflecting both the intrinsic characteristics of the properties and the influence of the surrounding environment. By integrating these factors, the model aims to offer accurate and reliable predictions, aiding users such as prospective buyers, real estate agents, and researchers in making informed decisions.
